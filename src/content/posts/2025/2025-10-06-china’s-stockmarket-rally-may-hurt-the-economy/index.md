SOME CALL it 9/24 for short. On September 24th last year China’s officials decided to [engineer a rally](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2024/09/27/at-last-china-pulls-the-trigger-on-a-bold-stimulus-package) in the stockmarket. The central bank cut interest rates and bank reserve requirements. It also enabled companies to buy back their shares and institutional investors to leverage their balance-sheets more easily. The markets took the hint. Buy “everything”, advised an American hedge-fund manager.
