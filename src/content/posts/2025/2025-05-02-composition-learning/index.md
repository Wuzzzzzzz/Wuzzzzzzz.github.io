We all remember a time when we spoke proudly about becoming the next Bill Gates or Stephen Hawking, and it’s never wrong to dream big. As time passes by, we gradually realize that most of us are bound to stay ordinary. Yet there’s still a way of achieving excellency. As the saying goes, “If you cannot do great things, do small things in a great way.”  
A perfect life doesn't have to be so glorious or sparkling as grand plays performed in theatres. The true value lies in one's contribution to the society. Cleaner Chen, who works in our community, is an ideal example. Cleaner is certainly not a well-pay or the brightest profession to most. Chen, however, puts her heart and soul into it and views it as his way of serving the community, which is why she earns high reputation.

As a generation about to step into the fiercely competitive society, we are haunted by the feeling of worry and helplessness. If we strive for accomplishing remarkable success and becoming world-renowned, we’ll probably feel frustrated and disappointed. Only by realizing “Excellency derives from small matters” can we survive and thrive.
